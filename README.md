# MicroliteUtilities
Python scripts to help play or DM MicroliteD20

- monster - Will generate a random monster with stats and an attack, create a class for it
- character - Will help generate a character, with class values
- Dice - dice rolling and calculation utility
- equipment - equipment class, weapon, armor

## Notes
- May move to 2020 rules revision
- Work out how to integrate equipment list with char
- Maybe SQL time? add id to each char, relational db of monsters etc
